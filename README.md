# arduino-FC
Allows usage of arduino as complex flight controller. Works with MPU6050/9250

## TODO list
### Done
- [x] Implement quaternions
- [x] Reading from MPU-6050
- [x] Automatic calibration for MPU-6050
- [x] Complementary filter
### Major
- [ ] Drone: add adjustable positions for drone propellars and its impact on drone oriantation (how it changes pith and roll)
- [ ] Drone: hover ability
### Minor
- [ ] Make it functional with MPU-9250
- [ ] Add complementary filter for yaw using magnetometer from MPU-9250


## goals
- [ ] Hover for 30s
- [ ] Hover for 2min
- [ ] Survive weak external forces (push, pull, etc.)
- [ ] Survive stronger external forces
